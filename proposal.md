## About us

[UPchieve](https://upchieve.org/) is a nonprofit that connects high school students with live academic coaches. Our mission is to democratize access to academic support so that all students have an equal opportunity to finish high school, attend college, and achieve upward mobility. We provide free tutoring (math and science) and college counselling, available 24/7 to all low-income high school students in the US. 

We want to live in a world where you don’t need wealthy or educated parents to achieve your academic goals. We’ll make this a reality by ensuring every student in the US can access high-quality academic support anytime, anywhere, and from any device. 

Our 2030 goal: scale UPchieve to all 8 million low-income high school students in the US.

## About the project
We’re a small team taking on the monumental challenge of democratizing access to academic support. We’re also growing fast: last year we 100x’ed the number of weekly sessions happening on our platform (from 10/week to over 1,000/week)! 
### Problem:
- [Our code](https://gitlab.com/upchieve/) has not been written with new contributors in mind and is lacking a coherent contribution guide; 
- New contributors struggle with finding the most updated information as much of it has been an agreement between our dev team members
- As a result, it takes a lot of staff member time to onboard and guide a new contributor.
### Outcomes
- Creating an onboarding guide will help us streamline this process and significantly cut time from the first message to the first PR;
- The staff time that is now used to onboard each volunteer will be used to better guide and mentor the volunteers, providing them with a more rewarding experience overall.

## Project’s scope
The goal of this project is to create **an onboarding guide for new contributors**. 

The Onboarding guide project will:
- Audit the onboarding process and existing documentation and create a friction log of the current documentation for a new contributor (both a beginner and a more advanced programmer);
- Using the friction log as a guide for understanding the gaps in the documentation, create updated documentation;
- Create a `contributing.md` guide; 
- Create a quick "cheat sheet" to help contributors new to pull requests and GitHub to help them be able to use our process;
- Create a terminology "cheat sheet" to standarize the vocabulary used by team members and contributors alike;
- Incorporate feedback from documentation testers (volunteers in the project), as well as one's experience of the onboarding;
- Test the updated onboarding documentation on the new contributors joining the team.

Work that is out-of-scope for this project:
- This project will not create any GitHub tutorials; instead, the cheat sheet will link to existing material that is relevant and helpful.

### Timeline 
This is the process we envision could be most helpful:
- **Week 1-2**: The writer gets themselves onboarded in a recorded session; the experience serves as a user experience test in that it will help them identify the weaknesses of the current process; apart from the onboarding to our code base, the writer will also participate in our weekly contributor stand down, as well as be welcomed to our contributor sack channel;
- **Week 3-6**: The writer translates the onboarding process into a Markdown document to serve as a starting point for the guide;
- **Weeks 7-12**: The writer familiarizes themselves with the pain points of the contributors relating to the documentation; this may include noticing common themes in the weekly stand down, conducting short interviews, reading the slack channel, or, by trying to contribute a simple feature themselves;
- **Weeks 13-16**: The writer creates an onboarding guide for new contributors that consists of the following parts:
  - welcome and getting started
  - contribution guide and process
  - terminology explained
  - file directory
- **Weeks 17-22**: Onboarding of new contributors to test and further improve this process
- **Weeks 22-24**: Wrap-up, feedback, retro, report, learnings for the future. 

We have one strong technical writing candidate for this project, and we estimate that this work will take six months to complete. [Sylwia Vargas](www.github.com/sylwiavargas) has committed to supporting the project.

Throughout the process, the writer will have access to and support of our team members. This will be a collaborative process that is meant to help the writer gain more experience in contributing to Open Source, managing documentation processes and supporting nonprofit tech.

## Success measurement
In measuring the project’s success, we will look into qualitative and quantitative data from both the staff and contributor side. 

On the one hand, we will measure the time new contributors and staff members spend on onboarding and we expect this time to be significantly cut down for both parties. We will gather feedback on the onboarding process and look into how fast a volunteer can start contributing. Given that good documentation results in less cognitive load, we expect that the time since the first message exchange to the first PR will decrease. 

We also expect that a positive contributor experience means an increase in the number of closed issues tagged with “good first issue”, as well as strengthened contributor community. While the former is self-evident, the latter will be measured by  questions asked and answered by contributors on the Slack channel without the staff assistance.

## About the Technical Writer

Here are the skills we view as essential ("must-have"s) and additional ("nice-to-have"s) that would ensure alignment of our goals.

### Must have: 
- Familiarity with Gitlab (or willingness to work through Gitlab tutorials) and Slack; 
- A personal connection to our cause or a demonstrable interest in education or serving low-income populations.

### Nice to have: 
- Familiarity with our stack (Vue, MongoDB, TypeScript, Node, Postgres).

## Contact
Technical writers interested in working on this project should send an email to [recruitment@upchieve.org](mailto:recruitment@upchieve.org) with a subject line “Season of Docs - [Your Name]”. Please include links to your technical writing work or portfolio/résumé/CV.

Once onboarded, [our team](https://upchieve.org/team) is happy to answer all your questions, specifically:
- Dave can help with answering questions about devOps, our stack and engineering process;
- Trey is happy to walk through current contribution process with technical writer and review docs pull requests.
